  - `gulp serve`

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder

  - **gulp serve**

> Include any additional steps as needed.

## Deep Links & Print

- Navigate directly to a company: append `#view=company&org=<slug>` (example: `#view=company&org=climeworks`).
- Map stub for upcoming geo view: `#view=map&org=<slug>` keeps the same company selected when you swap tabs.
- Print/save the exec brief: open `#view=brief&org=<slug>`; use the browser’s print dialog to export to PDF.
- Cmd/Ctrl-click any “Open 360” link to compare multiple orgs side-by-side in separate tabs.
